Final Assignment

Topic: Learning a language
What is the subject at hand? Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?
This program will teach and help ELL students to master the four essential skills in language learning. This website will consist of fun exercises that will assess the student’s comprehension and performance. The application will provide students with a fun experience to learn English. The website ESL Fun! will teach students how to respectfully communicate with their peers and survive in the real world.


Problem: What is the problem you're trying to solve?
Learning the pronunciation of words is one of the challenges ELL students run into when learning English. Another problem an ELL students may encounter when using an educational application is learning how to navigate the application in English. Educators must be mindful that not all ELL students have prior knowledge on how to use an online tool especially if the application consist of English terms. Guided practice will be necessary when introducing and motivating students to use this application as a tool to learn English. Understanding what is required for them to complete can be consider a challenge for ELL students often run into when learning this topic. The problem that I am trying to solve is to use the website
“ESL FUN!” as a tool to teach ELL students word recognition which will help the students to learn how to read and the pronunciation of the words.


Target Audience: Who is your target audience? Describe in detail
The website ESL FUN! will teach and accommodate ELL students from grades 1-2. These students are from Spanish speaking countries.	To teach ELL students how to read, write and communicate in English, the website will consist of visual aids. The benefits of using visual aids in a ESL classroom can surely help students to understand and remember concepts more easily.  A short video clip introducing and demonstrating to the students basic English vocabulary words that is used daily will be implemented in this application. The video will teach students the meaning of each word and how to properly use the words in a sentence.  This will be consider one of the most effective strategies to introduce and help students to gain a clear understanding of the meaning of the vocabulary words and the proper way of how to use the vocabulary word within a sentence. Guided practice and modeling will serve as an important strategy to encourage and help guide the students when using this application. This application will encourage ELL students to practice the process of pronouncing the words that are introduced to them. When an application is not user friendly it tends to fall short. When an application falls short it can be due to a topic or visual aids that are not friendly or does not interest or encourage students to make connections.
